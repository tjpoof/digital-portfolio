                            <p>I started messing around with computers when I was roughly ten years old. This started mainly by playing various games on Steam, which evolved into me playing around with various tools such as Photoshop and eventually programming. What kickstarted this interest was modding videogames such as Minecraft, where I created some very basic mods to add various items into the game at around thirteen years old. Since then, I have had a growing interest in learning how to develop various things, which has led me to completing a bachelors degree in Computer Science at the University of West Florida.</p>
